Oh, hello there. This is my personal portfolio website, though it is rarely updated and mostly serves as the public front-end for a few random things I attach to this domain.

Tools I use and self-hosted services this domain runs are listed on the [Uses](/uses) page. If you'd like to contact me or find me elsewhere, I have email and so on listed on the [Homepage](/). Or, [my resume](https://standardresume.co/r/jeremy-d-collins).

### Some of my Previous Full-Time Work
* [MasterClass](https://masterclass.com)
    * MasterClass is an online learning video platform, but probably the most well-known one amongst the whole category of ed services like this. As a member of the Growth Engineering team, I worked on deploying and managing A/B test experiemnts, and transitoned React pages served by Ruby to a NextJS frontend with Rails API.
* [HitRecord Web](https://hitrecord.org)
    * HitRecord as a service is a collaboration tool for users, focused on positivity and being a welcoming network. Behind the curtain, it is an Angular web front-end and native mobile clients powered by a Rails API. The web and mobile clients are new, clean, and we took pride in making them as good as they can be.
* [Event Farm](https://eventfarm.com)
    * EventFarm is an experiential event management platform with third-party data import and export (such as Salesforce). I was focused on the front-end Angular and React products, developed an iOS app, and got to work with many great team members during my many years there.
* [Act-On](https://act-on.com)
    * Act-On is a marketing automation platform, allowing the client to track an individual's progress in the lead-gen funnel and launch targeted marketing based on their behavior, and is designed to complement existing CRM solutions already in place by the client. As part of this team, I migrated from a customer support role, to a more "white-glove" developer support role, and finally to the developer team for the landing page and email builder tool.

For other side-project or "for fun" work I've published, see the [Projects](/projects) page, or [GitHub](https://github.com/jdodsoncollins).

### About this website

This site is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and hosted via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard).

As far as UI goes, this site implements and extends the theme [Minimal Blog by LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog), with the following customizations:
- Overridden primary components (header, footer, homepage, post)
- A few added utility components (such as a graphql optimized image-loader component and root wrapper)
- New hooks and texts
- [Theme UI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/theme-ui/) overrides (most notably, the site should automatically toggle light or dark mode depending on your device settings, if applicable)
