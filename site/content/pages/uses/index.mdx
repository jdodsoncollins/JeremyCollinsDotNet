Here is a list of hardware, software, and settings I use routinely. All these things allow me to get better work done, make my life easier in general ... or are just fun to tinker with.

#### üíª Hardware
* MacBook Pro
* iPhone
* Rapberry Pi 4B -- latest gen can be a very capable NAS (I have it acting as a network Time Machine, and Pi-Hole)
* [ASRock A300](https://www.asrock.com/nettop/AMD/DeskMini%20A300%20Series/) mini-pc dual-booting Windows 11 and Ubuntu. I love small form factor PC building! This one is *very* small form factor I'd say, and serves as a general Plex server and remote drive.
* Eero 6 Pro wifi mesh network. I previously had a more fiddly wifi system with more config options, but grew a little tired of all the management it required.

#### üß© Dev Setup 
* Visual Studio Code
* XCode
* [One Monokai Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=azemoh.one-monokai)
* ESLint & Prettier -- implemented on codebases I touch, for sanity
* Docker
* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) -- git visualization & diffing
* [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/)

#### ‚õÖÔ∏è Self-Hosted
* [Traefik](https://containo.us/traefik/) -- Used to reverse-proxy the containers on this server, and auto-refreshes [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)
* [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) -- RSS fetching software, running on [miniflux.jeremycollins.net](https://miniflux.jeremycollins.net)
* [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/) -- DNS control and fun stats on home network traffic
* [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/)
* [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) -- FOSS Plex alternative with a good community

#### üéí Other software / services I use all the time
* [Reeder](https://reederapp.com/) -- RSS reader
* 1Password -- for 2FA and generated passwords, plus tracking membership numbers and software licenses
* Parallels -- it can run the Mac's bootcamped Windows partition from within macOS when I don't want to reboot
* [Pixelmator](https://www.pixelmator.com/) -- image & photo editing
* VNC
* [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/) -- the best cross-platform podcast manager
* Audible
* Spotify
* [Infuse](https://firecore.com/infuse) -- a video player client for Plex, iTunes, any other network protocol with an amazing UI and great filetype compatibility
