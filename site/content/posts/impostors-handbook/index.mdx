I'm self-taught, and over the years of me working as a developer full-time, I've gone through a few phases:

1. When first learning, I wish I had a CS degree purely for the luxury of having time to digest things. Even syntax confused me. Imagine learning to code and seeing `String string=new String("example")`. Understandably, it is a deliberately confusing one-line example but I saw this personally many times (why not use better variable names or use newer syntax?). There's a lot to unpack in that one short line.

2. Then I got the basics down, convinced someone to actually pay me while I learned on the job, and viewed a CS degree as unnecessary -- this is all stuff I could pick up with experience, right?

3. Next, a few years in, I run into enough complex patterns and concepts that others with a formal education seem to just get, but I ... didn't. Or I did, but more slowly. And I felt like the slowpoke in the room.

Before reaching stage 3, my self-learning system consisted of [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and its competitors, or mashing together online tutorials like everyone else does. I've started 100 side-projects and finished a few, absorbing learnings along the way. Then, the past few years I've gone deeper, and started actually reading some *actual books*. 

But there's one worth calling out specifically. I've gotten more mileage out of [The Impostor's Handbook](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/) than any other book or video series I've followed. It's truly underrated -- the writing is at just the right level. It covers Big O notation, Lambda notation, and other more classical CS fundamentals in an extremely approachable way.
