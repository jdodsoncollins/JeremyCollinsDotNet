- [GitHub](https://github.com/jdodsoncollins) -- Though please bear in mind most work of mine is closed-source.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jollins) -- I rarely tweet but use my long follow list as a news/commentary feed, as well as a surprisingly good developer learning resource.
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-collins-37807911/) -- Kept up to date; consider this my online resume.
- [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25277306-jeremy) -- I read (or listen to audiobooks) a lot. It makes me happy, and maybe makes me seem smarter than I really am.
